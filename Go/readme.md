# PhantasmaSDK

## Go Sample app

This is a simple wallet sample that needs to be connected to a RPC node. By default it uses the localhost:7077/rpc endpoint, but you can switch to your own URL.

To run the sample app, follow these steps:

1. Get "jsonrpc.go" from https://github.com/Cori1109/jsonrpc

2. Put it in %GOROOT%/src/github.com/Cori1109/jsonrpc on your pc

3. Copy phantasma.go from Output/temp/Go/Libs to %GOROOT%/src/phantasma

4. Run the sample app!
